    "The bag-of-words model basically does what it says on the tin. In a body of text, all the words are cut up and put into the model without relational values or weighted importance. Each word is treated as independent and equal. This is different from othe n-gram mosel where words are associated with one another, and these associations impact the value of the word in the model. Bag-of-words is basically a type of n-gram model, only that n=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifier is a condictional probabilistic model based on Bayes Theorem. Similar to bag-of-words, Niave Bayes considers each condition as independent and equal. That is why it is called Naive. For example, to predict the sales of an icecream van, this classifier considers the weather and the location of the van as independent conditions that act on thier own to influence the probability. A more sophisticated algorithm will see that an ice-cream van located in Ghana, is more likely to have hot weather and thus more likely to sell more icecream than say one located in Norway.\n",
    "Bayes theorem sort of stratifies different conditions in a logical way and calculates the probaility of a certain outcome on the probabilities associated with each condition.\n",
    "$ P(B|A)=P(A|B)P(B)P(A)$\n",
    " P(A/B) is the probability of A if we already know that B has occurred and is known as likelihood.\n",
